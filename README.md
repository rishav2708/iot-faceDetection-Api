# iot-faceDetection-Api
A face detection API from an IP Camera

this api is used to extract face and detect them using a created database.

To create a database you need to:

  * a well configured IP camera to your wlan 
  * run the script sources/face_detect.py to detect and test the software
  * after creating a database use recognition.py to train the dataset and machine
  * server.py needs to be run on flask and this information can be accessed by any machine available on same lan!!
   
A good stuff for remote projects involving robotics and artificial intelligince, can be easily used with raspberry pi
